Cat vs Dog Classification with SVM
This project is part of my internship work and demonstrates building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model 
to classify images of cats and dogs using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features. The dataset is processed 
from a zipped folder containing labeled images for training the classifier.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV – For image loading and preprocessing
NumPy – For numerical operations
scikit-learn – For model building, evaluation, and splitting the dataset
scikit-image – For extracting HOG features
joblib – For saving the trained model
tqdm – For displaying loading progress
